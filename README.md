# Project Title

Token Creation

## Description

The code defines a Solidity contract called MyToken. It has three public variables, tokenname, tokenAbbrv, and totalSupply. The contract also has a mapping variable balances that maps addresses to token balances.

The mint function allows for the creation of new tokens and adds them to the balance of a specified address. The burn function reduces the token balance of an address by a specified amount, as long as the balance is sufficient.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

* paste the github code in remix ide
* compile the code 
* deploy the code
* Copy the address of your account
* paste it in the balance (initially balance will be zero)
* then mint some token by giving two parameters value
